##  Description
This repository contains the evaluation scripts to evaluate Coreference Resolution models on the BookCoref Benchmark.
We also include the official outputs of the comparison systems, which can be used to reproduce our results.
Our silver training and gold evaluation data can be found on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/sapienzanlp/bookcoref).
<!-- (we also release wightf of berst performing model bla bla)-->
